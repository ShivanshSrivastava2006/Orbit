# 🌌 Orbit

Orbit is a social connection-based mobile app designed to help users spontaneously hang out with their 1st and 2nd-degree connections. Built with React Native and Firebase, Orbit lets users create micro-gatherings by sending subtle hangout prompts — only visible to friends-of-friends if a mutual approves. It visualizes social proximity and helps reduce social hesitation by making reach-outs frictionless.

---

## 🧠 Concept

Orbit is built on the idea that most people hesitate to ask others to hang out — even when they’re just a degree away. Instead of broadcasting or sliding into DMs, Orbit lets you:

- 👥 Select your core friends (1st-degree)
- 🌐 Discover 2nd-degree friends connected via them
- 📤 Send hangout ideas subtly to a small group
- ✅ Require mutual approval before reaching someone once removed

This keeps interactions casual, safe, and socially natural.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/orbit.git
   cd orbit

# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
