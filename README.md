# üåå Orbit ‚Äî Spontaneous Hangouts through Social Proximity

Orbit is a mobile app that lets you hang out with people who are already within reach ‚Äî your close friends and their close friends. Built with React Native and Firebase, Orbit helps reduce hesitation by offering a safe and subtle way to reach out socially.

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like meeting a friend-of-a-friend, but without the awkward cold DM.‚Äù

---

## üß† Core Concept

Orbit is built on one insight: people are more likely to hang out if they know they‚Äôre just a degree apart.

Instead of broadcasting plans, Orbit introduces a trust-based system:

- üë• Choose your core circle (your 8 closest friends)
- üåê Discover your extended circle (friends of those friends)
- üì§ Send subtle, low-pressure hangout prompts
- ‚úÖ Messages reach 2nd-degree connections only if mutuals approve

The goal: remove friction, make small spontaneous plans easier, and preserve comfort & boundaries.

## üß™ Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivanshSrivastava2006/Orbit.git
   cd orbit
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install firebase  # Required for authentication and Firestore
   ```

   Or with yarn (recommended if npm gives trouble):

   ```bash
   yarn install
   yarn add firebase
   ```
3. Install required Expo packages:

   ```bash
   npx expo install expo-av
   npx expo install expo-linear-gradient
   npx expo install @expo-google-fonts/orbitron expo-font
   npx expo install @expo-google-fonts/poppins expo-font
   npx expo install @expo-google-fonts/poppins expo-font react-native-animatable
   npx expo install expo-blur
   npx expo install expo-image-picker

   ```

5. Start the Expo app:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   You‚Äôll see a QR code in the terminal. Use any of the following:

   - üì± Scan with Expo Go on Android(Playstore)/iOS
     üö® _Make sure that your laptop and phone should be on the same Wifi network_ 
     
   - üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Press 'w' to directly open using Web App
   - üß™ Use a development build
   - üíª Launch on Android emulator
   - üçè Open in iOS simulator

   Learn more here:  
   [Expo Development Builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)

   - (Optional) If the app crashes or screens aren‚Äôt loading correctly:
   
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```
   
6. (Required) If you want to test OTP login, setup the mock OTP API:

   See section below: [üîå Mock OTP API (Local Testing)](#-mock-otp-api-local-testing)

---

## üîå Mock OTP API (Local Testing)

This project uses a mock Express server to simulate OTP-based login. To run it locally:

1. In a separate terminal:

   ```bash
   cd otp-mock-api
   npm install
   node index.js
   ```

2. You should see:

   ```
   ‚úÖ Server running at http://localhost:5050
   ```

3. Replace the URL in `screens/OtpScreen.js` with your local IP address _(step - 4)_ (not localhost).

   Demonstrated:

   ```js
   const res = await fetch("http://192.168.x.x:5050/send-otp", { // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è edit YOUR IP ADDRESS HERE
   ```
   and
   ```js
   const res = await fetch("http://192.168.x.x:5050/verify-otp", { // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è edit YOUR IP ADDRESS HERE
   ```

4. To find your IP: 

   - On macOS:
   - 
     ```bash
     ipconfig getifaddr en0
     ```
     
   - On Windows (Command Prompt):
   - 
     ```cmd
     ipconfig
     ```
     
     Look under "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi" > IPv4 Address.

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your phone and laptop are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Localhost won‚Äôt work on mobile.

## üßº Reset the Starter Code

Want to start from a clean slate?

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This moves all demo code into the app-example/ folder and gives you a blank app/ directory to begin fresh development.
